This repo was created in order to gather some knowledge regarding different [esoteric programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) and play around with them

Overview
--------

An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test 
the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, 
as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), 
or as a joke. The use of esoteric distinguishes these languages from programming languages that working developers use to write software. 
Usually, an esolang's creators do not intend the language to be used for mainstream programming, although some esoteric features, 
such as visuospatial syntax, have inspired practical applications in the arts. 
Such languages are often popular among hackers and hobbyists.
Usability is rarely a goal for esoteric programming language designersâ€”often it is quite the opposite. 
Their usual aim is to remove or replace conventional language features while still maintaining a language that is Turing-complete, 
or even one for which the computational class is unknown.
